# Keeping in mind there are 86400 seconds per day, write a program that calculates how many seconds there are in a week, if a week is 7 days.
# Print the result to the screen. Note: Your result should be in the format of just a number, not a sentence.

# Enter code here:
segundos_dia = 86400
segundos_semana = 7 * segundos_dia
print(segundos_semana)

# Should print 604800
